This is a tetris-like game for Papilio One 500K + Aracade Megawing.
You need a VGA monitor and optionally a Atari/Commodore compatible joystick.
I've used Papilio ZAP IDE 2.3.0.
The included bit file is configured to use internal pull-up resistors 
for joystick input. Forked ZPUino-HDL can be found here with the modified
.ucf file:

I've written this first for PIC18F6622. I ported it to Dingoo A320 later.
Now it can run Papilio One as well.
