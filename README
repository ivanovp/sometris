This is a tetris-like game for Papilio One 500K + Aracade Megawing.
You need a VGA monitor and optionally a Atari/Commodore compatible joystick.
I've used Papilio DesignLab 1.0.8.
The included bit file is the re-synthetized version of Arcade MegaWing
circuit. Somehow DesignLab's .bit file is not working properly: joystick
buttons are not working.

I've written this first for PIC18F6622. I ported it to Dingoo A320 later.
Now it can run Papilio One as well.
